* [Monkey patches](#monkey-patches)

## Configurations

Any and all monkey patches must be explicitly included anywhere you want to use it.

To globally use the monkey patches, just create an initializer requiring them.

`rails g lite:measurements:install` will generate the following file:
`../config/initalizers/lite_measurements.rb`

They can be disabled by commenting any of them out.

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches'

# - or-

# require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches/digital_storage'
# require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches/length'
# require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches/mass'
# require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches/temperature'
# require 'lite/measurements/monkey_patches/time'
```

## Measurements

* [Digital Storage](https://github.com/drexed/lite-measurements/blob/master/docs/DIGITAL_STORAGE.md)
* [Length](https://github.com/drexed/lite-measurements/blob/master/docs/LENGTH.md)
* [Mass](https://github.com/drexed/lite-measurements/blob/master/docs/MASS.md)
* [Temperature](https://github.com/drexed/lite-measurements/blob/master/docs/TEMPERATURE.md)
* [Time](https://github.com/drexed/lite-measurements/blob/master/docs/TIME.md)

## Monkey patches

Including monkey patches will give you `Numeric` access to conversions.

```ruby
2.convert_temperature(from: :fahrenheit, to: :celsius) #=> -16.666666666666668
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
