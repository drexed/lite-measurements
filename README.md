## Monkey patches

Including monkey patches will give you `Numeric` access to conversions.

```ruby
2.convert_temperature(from: :fahrenheit, to: :celsius) #=> -16.666666666666668
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
