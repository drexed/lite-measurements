## Configurations

`rails g lite:measurements:install` will generate the following file:
`../config/initalizers/lite-measurements.rb`

```ruby
Lite::Measurements.configure do |config|
  config.monkey_patches = true
end
```

## Monkey-patches

Including a measurements monkey patches will give you numeric access to conversions.

```ruby
2.convert_temperature(from: :fahrenheit, to: :celsius) #=> -16.666666666666668
```

## Temperature

Option | Type | Default
--- | --- | ---
from, to | symbol | `:celsius`, `:fahrenheit`, `:kelvin`

```ruby
temperature = Lite::Measurements::Temperature.new(2)
temperature = temperature.convert(from: :fahrenheit, to: :celsius)      #=> -16.666666666666668

# - or -

Lite::Measurements::Temperature.convert(2, from: :celsius, to: :kelvin) #=> 275.15

# - or -

2.convert_temperature(from: :kelvin, to: :fahrenheit)                   #=> -456.07
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
